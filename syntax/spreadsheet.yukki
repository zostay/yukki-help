# Spreadsheet Plugin

The spreadsheet plugin, when enabled, allows your wiki pages to perform calculations. Calculations may even be performed across wiki pages. This is somewhat experimental and it is likely that extensive spreadsheet calculations will lead to decreased performance.

## Configuration

To configure the spreadsheet plugin, you just need to add the plugin to those listed in the `plugins` key in the `yukki.conf` configuration:

    plugins:
        - module: Spreadsheet

## Using Spreadsheet Variables

Wherever you want to use a spreadsheet calculation, you just need to embed a short declaration like this:

    \{{=:the_answer:42}}

which looks like this in the page:

{{=:the_answer:42}}

The spreadsheet calculation always starts with "\{{=:" and always ends with "}}". The second part is the name of the variable. This can be any word you like so long as it is only made of letters, numbers, and underscores. For example,

    the_answer
    foo
    a

But not:

    the answer
    foo!
    a-or-b

This second part is actually optional and may be omitted. Make sure you leave out the colon between the second and third parts as well:

    \{{=:32+10}}

like this:

{{=:32+10}}

The third part of the format is the calculation to perform. This can be any standard spreadsheet calculation function or operation. For example,

    \{{=:a:32}} + \{{=:b:10}} = \{{=:[a]+[b]}}

which looks like this:

{{=:a:32}} + {{=:b:10}} = {{=:[a]+[b]}}

## Cross References on Different Pages

It is possible to refer to variables defined on a different page. This is done by naming the page inside the variable reference like so:

    \{{=:c:SQRT([yukki:syntax/spreadsheet!a]^2 + [syntax/spreadsheet!b]^2)}}

like so:

{{=:c:SQRT([yukki:syntax/spreadsheet!a]^2 + [syntax/spreadsheet!b]^2)}}

This example shows the repository as well as the full patch to the wiki page in the first variable and just the path in the second. If your page is in the same repository, you may omit the repository.

Be careful with this operation, as it requires fetching the other pages referenced and performing all the calculations found there.
